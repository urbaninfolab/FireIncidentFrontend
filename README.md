Welcome to the Fire and Smoke Digital Twin Frontend, a state-of-the-art platform for visualizing real-time smoke and fire incidents. This project utilizes two different interfaces to provide the most comprehensive perspective on fire incidents and their impacts. The 2D version uses Leaflet along with KML smoke files generated by VSmoke, whereas the 3D version integrates MapBox and Threebox.js with FBX smoke files produced by MantaFlow fluid simulation. 

The data driving these visualizations is provided by the [Fire and Smoke Digital Twin API](https://github.com/UrbanInfoLab/FireIncidentData), which serves as an endpoint for all collected data. This API provides real-time access to fire incident data from cities across the US, including the predicted impact of these incidents. 

The fire incident data and the generated smoke files are provided by the [Backend](https://github.com/UrbanInfoLab/FireIncidentBackend). This component of our platform is responsible for collecting fire incident data from various city databases, processing this data, and generating the smoke files that are used by our visualization tools.

# Getting Started with Fire & Smoke Digital Twin Frontend

To get started with the Fire and Smoke Digital Twin Frontend, check out the [API documentation](https://github.com/UrbanInfoLab/FireIncidentData) and the [Backend documentation](https://github.com/UrbanInfoLab/FireIncidentBackend) for more information on how the data is collected and processed. Then, explore the code in this repository to see how we use this data to create our 2D and 3D visualizations.
